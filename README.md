# logger_tg
A simple logger for your own Telegram messages.

It creates a separate new session.  
First, you need to obtain api_id and api_hash from https://core.telegram.org/api/obtaining_api_id And enter those values into the logger.
You also need to create a new channel where the messages will be forwarded, and enter its id into the logger.
On the first launch, you'll need login to your account.

Requires Python 3 and the Telethon library to work.
